# StarWarsGame_xd
  a star wars theme game - the main purpose is applying the shortest path algorithms
  made for school assignment.
  
  you select a player (master yoda or luke skywalker) and game will start. your goal is reach the cell right next to golden cup before your enemies catch you.
  there are two kind of good guys:
  * Master Yoda -> he has 6 healths, so you can get caught up to 6 times before game over.
  * Luke Skywalker -> luke has only 3 healths :/
  
  there will be three kind of bad guys:
  * Darth Vader -> can move through walls.    
  * Kylo Ren -> he can walk 2 steps at once.
  * Stormtrooper -> regular enemy.
  
  we're reading the enemy data from harita.txt, so in order to change the enemies, you must've change the harita.txt file.
  
  for move across the map, use arrow keys.
